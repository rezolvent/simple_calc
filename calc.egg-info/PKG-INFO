        =====
        
        Calc is a simple Django app to calculate same expression.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "calc" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'calc',
            )
        
        2. Add values for email sending to your EMAIL_USE_TLS, EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT setting like this::
        
            EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
            EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
            EMAIL_PORT = 587
        
        
        3. Include the calc URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            url(r'^calc/', include('calc.urls')),
        
        4. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the calc models.
        
        5. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           to create a calc (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
        
        6. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/calculator/ to participate in the calc.
